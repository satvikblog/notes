- Information Gathering is also called as " **reconnaissance** "
- In Information Gathering we have two categories
  1. **Active Information Gathering**
  2. **Passive Information Gathering**
- Information gathering is the first step of any penetration test and involves gathering or collecting information about an individual, company, website or system that you are targeting.
- **Passive information gathering** - Involves gathering as much information as possible without actively engaging with the target.
- **Active information gathering** - Involves gathering as much information as possible by actively engaging with the target system. (You will require authorization in order to perform active information gathering)
