# NOTES

**Def :** Linux distributions - or distros - are operating systems based on the Linux kernel. They are used for various purposes, from servers and embedded devices to desktop computers and mobile phones. Each Linux distribution is different, with its own set of features, packages, and tools.

- **Ubuntu**
- **Fedora**
- **CentOs**
- **Debian**
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**

Many users choose Linux for their desktop computers because it is free, open source, and highly customizable. Ubuntu and Fedora are two popular choices for desktop Linux and beginners.

We can use those distros everywhere, including (web) servers, mobile  
devices, embedded systems, cloud computing, and desktop computing. For  
cyber security specialists, some of the most popular Linux distributions  
are but are not limited to:
